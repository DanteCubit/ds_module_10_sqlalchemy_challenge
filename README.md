For this challenge I used to provided data to do climate analysis in Honolulu Hawaii.

For part 1 I used Python and SQLAlchemy to conect to a SQLite database, build tables, perform precipitation analysis, load query results into data frames, and plot the results.

For park 2 I designed a Flask API based on the queries from part 1, using Flask to jsonify the results to convert the API data into a JSON responce object for my climate app.
